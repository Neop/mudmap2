a bug report on GitHub (https://github.com/Neop/mudmap2/issues), so I
can fix it.

Installation
A JRE (Java Runtime Environment) needs to be installed on your computer.
You can get it here: https://www.java.com/de/download/index.jsp 
Place the mudmap.jar file wherever you like. It should run after a 
double-click on the mudmap.jar file or right click on it, select
"open/run with", then select something siliar to "Java JRE" (It depends
on your operating system)

Portable mode
When you start MUD Map for the first time you will be asked whether
you'd like to use MUD Map in portable mode. In this case the world files
will be stored in the same directory as the mudmap2.jar.

If you don't use portable mode, you can find the files here:
Linux: ~/.mudmap/
Windows: %appdata%\mudmap\

Updating
Just replace the old mudmap2.jar file with a new one.

Compatibility to MUD Map 1
MUD Map 2 uses an improved version of the file format of MUD Map 1. It
can read worlds that were created with MUD Map 1 and saves them in a
compatible format if compatibility is enabled (is enabled by 
default)

How to use MUD Map:
I didn't create a manual for MUD Map 2 yet, so please refer to the 
manual of MUD Map 1, which is very similar: http://mudmap.sf.net

Keyboard commands
Keyboard commands can be used to navigate and alter the map if keyboard
place selection is enabled by pressing p. A red box should be visible on
the screen. You might have to click at the map once after you opened it
for it to be able to receive keyboard events.

The keys used here are not final and might not be optimal. Please let me
know if you think that other keys should be used ;)
